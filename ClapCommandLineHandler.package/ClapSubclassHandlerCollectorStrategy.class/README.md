I am a subclass of ClapHandlerCollectorStrategy. I don`t have any collection stored. Whenever my collectHandlers is sent a message, I will check all the subClasses of ClapCommandLineHandler, gather them and return all of them. So, that way unlike ClapHandlerCollectionStrategy I van`t have a specific set of classes. So, I can be used for production or testing too when all the subClasses are needed.
