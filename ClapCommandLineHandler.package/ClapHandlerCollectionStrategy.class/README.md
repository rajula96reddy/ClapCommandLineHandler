I am a subclass of ClapHandlerCollectionStrategy. I have a collection stored with me. I am used when there is a need to test a few definite classes instead of all subclasses of ClapCommandLineHandler. To create a instance of me with a collection just do ClapHandlerCollectionStrategy new withAll: [Class1 . Class2 ] so on. This is way I am just used to have a customized collection of subclass for testing and any other purposes.
