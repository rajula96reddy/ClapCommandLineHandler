I am the base class for the ClapCommandLineHandler package. Any new handler to be created should be a subclass to this. I have all the important methods for integrating Clap and the CommandLine. I have few methods for echoing out on the command line.  I am a handler for all the clap commands. When arguments are given as input, I first take the first argument which will be the clapCommand name and checks if there is any handler for that command and if there is one I activate that command with a match of all the arguments else I give out an error. I activate the subClass activate with aMatch, this aMatch should be used to get if this is a ClapCommandMatch and to retrieve matched data.  So the subClass activate is responsibile for handling the outputs.

To create a new handler, create a subclass to me, and to the new subclass add command named method with the creation of ClapCommand on the class side and on the instance side, have a method named 'activate: aMatch' which takes the match and handles the output.
