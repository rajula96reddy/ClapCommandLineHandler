I am here  to help use the Strategy Design Pattern for the ClapCommandLineHandler. I have two subclasses ClapHandlerCollectionStrategy and ClapSubclassHandlerCollectorStrategy. To quickly explain my use and why strategy pattern, my subclasses have two different implementations in each for a same method 'collectHandlers'. And I also have that method, which is not defined and is a SubClassResponsibility. So, in the ClapCommandLineHandler, a new instance of this class can be created and depending on the use the subclass instance can be chosen at run time.
So that way there are two different collections from which one can be used for testing and the other for production.
